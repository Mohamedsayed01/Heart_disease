## Introduction

Heart disease remains one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide. Early detection can significantly improve patient outcomes. This project utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze medical data and predict the presence of heart disease, providing a useful tool for medical practitioners and researchers.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Multiple machine learning algorithms for prediction
- Model evaluation and comparison
- Easy to run and modify for further research

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is publicly available and contains various health metrics such as age, sex, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and more. For more details, refer to the dataset source included in the project.

## Installation

Clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Mohamedsayed01/Heart_disease.git

# Navigate into the project directory
cd Heart_disease

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the main script to train and evaluate the models:

```bash
python main.py
```

Ensure that the dataset path is correctly set in the code or configuration files if required.

## Model Explanation

This project includes several machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and others. The models are evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to determine the best performing algorithm.
